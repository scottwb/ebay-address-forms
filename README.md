This project contains a series of screenshots taken from eBay's registration process for various English-speaking countries. They do a good job of illustrating the differences in things like City/State, Postal Code, etc. between these countries. This is useful for discussions on projects that want to accept address fields from countries outside the US, and how it is not necessarily trivial nor the right thing to do, to have a one-size-fits-all form...but that this can also introduce additional development complexity.
